# Global tolerances for floating point comparisons
# This prevents tests from failing due to tiny rounding errors (e.g., 1.000001 vs 1.0)
tolerances:
  absolute: 0.001   # For direct value comparisons
  percent: 0.05     # 5% tolerance for rough checks
  statistical: 0.05 # p-value thresholds or sigma

# Section 1: Core Experimental Results
# Replace these with your specific domain data.
# The keys (e.g., 'experiment_a') can be anything you want.
results:

    p_value_threshold: 0.05
  
  experiment_b:
    # You can verify derived values (e.g. improvement over baseline)
    baseline_accuracy: 65.2

# Section 2: Figure Requirements
# The verifier checks if these files exist.
# If 'metadata_file' is provided, it checks the sidecar JSON file against the contract.
