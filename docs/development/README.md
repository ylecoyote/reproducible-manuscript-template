# Development Documentation

This folder contains internal design documents and implementation notes used during the development of the Reproducible Manuscript Template.

## For Users

**You don't need to read these** - see the main [README](../../README.md) for usage instructions and the [Getting Started guide](../../README.md#-quick-start).

## For Contributors

### General Documentation

These documents explain universal design principles and patterns:

- **[VS_DESIGN_FEEDBACK.md](VS_DESIGN_FEEDBACK.md)**: Expert design review and best practices
- **[VS_IMPLEMENTATION_FEEDBACK.md](VS_IMPLEMENTATION_FEEDBACK.md)**: Implementation review and lessons learned

### Case Study

The **[case-study/](case-study/)** folder contains the original development documentation from the real-world astrophysics project that inspired this template. This includes:

- Original design rationale and architecture
- Development timeline with actual incidents
- Expert feedback and refactoring process
- Domain-specific examples (astrophysics/Hubble tension)

These are preserved as a learning resource but are **not required reading** for using the template.

## Purpose

These docs serve as:
- **Context**: Understanding why certain approaches were chosen
- **Learning resource**: For others building similar verification systems
- **Contributor onboarding**: Helping new contributors understand the codebase
- **Historical record**: Tracking the evolution of the project
